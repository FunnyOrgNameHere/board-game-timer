# board-game-timer
Chess timer for more than 2 players. It is *very* hardcoded currently. We'll fix it eventually.

## installing
I don't know, honestly. `npm install` probably??
## running
`bun run index.tsx` or something

## TODO:
* ~~Add new player to list on join~~ DONE
* Fireworks displayed for the last player standing
* Switch current player to last player standing
